Work on small portions every day of work that will be due by the end of the week, starting with the most important tasks first.
a.)Do today's tasks. Concentrate On what is at hand, do not allow yourself to lose focus. Then move on to the next daily task. Once today's tasks are completed, mark them as such, and proceed to tomorrow's tasks.
 b.) When tomorrow's tasks are complete, work on the other tasks due by the end of the week, and when those are complete, work on the tasks due early next week. A small portion of each is better than one huge,laborious task and will keep your time managed more efficiently and reduce stress and eliminate burn-out.
c.) Make one of your final daily tasks the completion of tomorrow's task list. <blockquote>Each day should be ended with a new task sheet for tomorrow to keep you on track.</blockquote>
